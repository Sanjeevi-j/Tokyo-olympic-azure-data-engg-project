# Azure Data Pipeline Project: End-to-End Data Engineering

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully automated data pipeline using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, **Azure Databricks**, and **Azure Synapse Analytics**. The pipeline efficiently ingests, transforms, and stores data for analysis, empowering data analysts to generate insights and create impactful dashboards.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- **Tool Used**: Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- **Process**: Used ADF to ingest data from a **.CSV** file and load it into **Azure Blob Storage**. ADF orchestrated the ingestion process, ensuring reliable and scheduled data extraction.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
- **Tool Used**: Azure Databricks
- **Process**: The raw data was processed and transformed using **Azure Databricks**, where complex transformations were carried out. PySpark was utilized to clean, format, and aggregate the data to make it suitable for analysis.

### 3. **Data Storage & Querying**
- **Tool Used**: Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Process**: The transformed data was stored in **Azure Synapse Analytics**, allowing for efficient querying and filtering of large datasets using SQL. This process enabled data analysts to work with structured, queryable data.

### 4. **Data Analysis & Insights**
- **Outcome**: The processed data was made accessible to data analysts for creating dashboards and conducting research. The insights derived from the data empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and visualize key metrics.

## Project Details

The project automates the data engineering workflow, allowing for seamless integration between **data ingestion**, **data transformation**, and **data querying**.

- **Step 1**: ADF ingests raw **.CSV** data into Azure Blob Storage.
- **Step 2**: Databricks processes the data, applying necessary transformations and business rules.
- **Step 3**: The cleaned data is stored in **Azure Synapse Analytics**, where analysts can use SQL to explore and query the data.
- **Step 4**: Analysts can build dashboards using the accessible, transformed data to derive insights and support business decision-making.
